Object Detection with TensorFlow.js

Project Overview:
----------------------
This project provides a real-time object detection system built using TensorFlow.js. It utilizes pre-trained models like Coco-SSD to detect and classify a wide range of objects directly in the browser or in a Node.js environment. With this system, you can implement object recognition in your applications without the need for backend infrastructure, making it ideal for web-based applications and client-side AI solutions.

Key Features:
----------------------
- Real-time object detection on images and video streams.
- Pre-trained Coco-SSD model capable of detecting 80 different objects.
- Works directly in the browser and Node.js environments.
- Fast and efficient, optimized for real-time performance.
- No backend needed; everything runs on the client-side (or server-side with Node.js).

Supported Platforms:
----------------------
- Web browsers: Use the browserâ€™s webcam or process static images for object detection.
- Node.js: Run the detection system in a server-side JavaScript environment.

Technologies Used:
----------------------
- TensorFlow.js: A powerful JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models.
- Coco-SSD: A pre-trained object detection model that can recognize 80 different object categories.
- OpenCV.js (optional): A library used for additional image processing and handling video streams.

Use Cases:
----------------------
- Security & Surveillance: Monitor live video feeds to automatically detect objects or people.
- Retail Automation: Detect products on shelves, track inventory, and assist customers.
- Web Applications: Add object detection features to web-based tools, games, or AR experiences.
- Robotics: Enable robots to detect and interact with objects in real-time.
